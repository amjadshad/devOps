# base

NOTE: This is a copy of [nextgen-charts-base](https://github.com/shellagilehub/nextgen-charts-base), `v0.3.1`.

This chart's goal is to standardize NextGen deployments. Its interface is not fully fixed yet, thus backwards-compatibility is not yet guaranteed. Though, 90%+ of the things are very likely to stay as they are.

Please, feel free to raise an issue should you discover any bugs or have certain feature requests.
