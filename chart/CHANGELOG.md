# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.1

- Added capability check for ServiceMonitor API to make sure a release doesn't fail in case ServiceMonitor is enabled, but CRD is not yet present in a cluster.

## 0.3.0

- Added support for deploying resources that are not part of the chart (same functionality as the incubator/raw chart offers).

## 0.2.0

- Added support for lifecycle hooks.

## 0.1.0
